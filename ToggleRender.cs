 * TODO: Use Delete function to delete AL2O3 specimen and enable two broken tensile on grabber.
 * TODO: Add particles and sound for the tensile animation. Should break the animation apart when you add particles.

/*
1. To enable this place the script into the specimen by adding components.
2. Set the two objects to the two broken tensile you want.
3. Make sure that the two broken tensile object's visibility is turned off in the initial state, by toggling MeshRenderer.
4. Go to lever, and add a script to "Lever Pressed" script.
5. Add "Al203 Specimen" as the object and set ToggleRender as the script to use.
6. In the drop down menu, select bool enabled, and set to true, checked.
You can copy this script and apply this to any other object by removing the Grabber string and using a different string.
You may render/derender multiple objects as well by replacing the Game Object to an array.
